# Setup Restricted Constraints

On an Openshift cluster you generally have `Restricted` [SCC](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html) applied as default. As long as the workload is deployed by a regular user, this [Restricted](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html#examining-a-security-context-constraints-object_configuring-internal-oauth) SCC applies by default. 

An Anthos cluster uses [Open Policy Agent](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/08/06/opa-gatekeeper-policy-and-governance-for-kubernetes/) (OPA) based Policy Controller Constraints. In this section we will see how to implement constraints using OPA. The [restricted_constraint.yaml](./policies/restricted/restricted_constraints.yaml) constraints file provides a list of constraints that map to Restricted SCC as an example.

**Note:** You may want to review and change the constraints or their scope in this file based on your organization's needs.

* Copy policies to your ACM configurations folder

```
mkdir -p clusterconfigs/cluster/policies/restricted
cp ./policies/restricted/restricted_constraints.yaml clusterconfigs/cluster/policies/restricted 
```
* Commit these changes to the git repo. ACM Policy Controller will apply these constraints to the target Anthos cluster.

*  Verify that the constraints are installed by running `kubectl get constraints`. You should see a list of constraints applied.

```

* Test by creating a workload that is not allowed

```
kubectl create ns test-policy
kubectl create -n test-policy -f policies/restricted/example-disallowed.yaml
```
And notice the rejection.
```

```

* Now test the workload with allowed configuration

```
kubectl create -n test-policy -f policies/restricted/example-allowed.yaml
```
and notice it gets deployed successfully

```
pod/restricted-pod-example created
```

* Cleanup

```
kubectl delete pod/restricted-pod-example -n test-policy
kubectl delete ns test-policy
```
