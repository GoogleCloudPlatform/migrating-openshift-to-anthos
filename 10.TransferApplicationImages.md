# Image Migration from OpenShift Internal Registry to GCR

If you are using OpenShift Internal Registry to store the application container images, you will need to export these images to a different registry to deploy them to the target cluster. If you are already using an external registry, you don't need to follow the steps explained in this section.

While you can use any container registry as the target container registry, this example uses GCR as the container registry. 


The steps below are tested on a Linux box. These do not work on Google Cloud Shell. 

* Install Docker on the host.


## Connecting to OpenShift Internal Registry 

* Get OpenShift Registry URL. 

    If you are using **OpenShift 4.x** expose the registry as `default_route` following the instruction [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/registry/securing-exposing-registry.html). 

    ```
    REGISTRY_URL=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    ```

    If you are using **OpenShift 3.x**, you will have to expose it yourself, as below. Confirm that the registry service is running in `default` OpenShift project and the service name is `image-registry` before running these commands , if not you may have to change these respective values.

    ```
    oc project default
    oc create route reencrypt --service=image-registry
    REGISTRY_URL=$(oc get route image-registry -n default -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    ```


* Get Root CA certificate from the created route. The command below saves the cert in a file with name `registry_ca.crt`. 
```
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect ${REGISTRY_URL}:443 < /dev/null |  awk '/BEGIN/ {c=1; print >"registry_ca.crt"; next} /END/ {print >"registry_ca.crt"; exit}; c{print >"registry_ca.crt"}'

```

* Copy this file to `/etc/docker/certs.d` folder.

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/$REGISTRY_URL
sudo cp registry_ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/$REGISTRY_URL/ca.crt
```

* Restart Docker

```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

* Login to the OpenShift internal registry

```
sudo docker login -u `oc whoami` -p `oc whoami -t` $REGISTRY_URL
```
You should see a message `Login Succeeded`

## Connecting to Target GCR 

```
gcloud auth print-access-token | sudo docker login -u oauth2accesstoken --password-stdin https://gcr.io
```
You should see a message `Login Succeeded`


## Migrate Images for an Application

For the application on the namespace you are trying to migrate, you can migrate the container images from source OpenShift Internal Registry to the target GCR repository as follows:

* Find the public URL of the source image. The imagestreams are exported to `ocp-manifests/namespaces` folder in the previous step and they all end with `*-is.yaml`

```
$ ls ocp-manifests/namespaces/$NAMESPACE/*-is.yaml

ocp-manifests/namespaces/development/myapp-is.yaml
```

* Get the name of the source container image from this image stream 

```
SOURCE_IMAGE=$(cat ocp-manifests/namespaces/development/myapp-is.yaml | yq e '.status.publicDockerImageRepository' - ):latest
```
* Pull the source image using `docker pull`

```
sudo docker pull $SOURCE_IMAGE
```
* Tag the image to the target repository. Substitute the value of the TARGET_REPO with your value before running this.

```
TARGET_REPO="gcr.io\/<<your-project>>"

export TARGET_IMAGE=$(echo $SOURCE_IMAGE | sed -e 's/'$REGISTRY_URL'/'$TARGET_REPO'/')
sudo docker tag $SOURCE_IMAGE $TARGET_IMAGE
```
* Push the image to target registry

```
sudo docker push $TARGET_IMAGE
```

If there are multiple imagestreams in the namespace, repeat the above steps for all image streams to migrate all the images.  


## Migrate all Images from the Cluster

If you want to migrate all the container images for the selected namespaces from source OpenShift Internal Registry to target GCR registry instead of doing it on a per namespace basis, run this script. This script may take several hours to run depending on the number of images to be migrated, their size and your connection speed to the source and target registries.

**NOTE:** Set the appropriate value for TARGET_REPO before running the script.

```
TARGET_REPO="gcr.io\/<<your-project>>"
```

```
for is in $(find ocp-manifests/ -name *-is.yaml); do
    SOURCE_IMAGE=$(cat $is | yq e '.status.publicDockerImageRepository' -):latest;
    echo "Pulling Image:" $SOURCE_IMAGE;
    sudo docker pull $SOURCE_IMAGE;
    TARGET_IMAGE=$(echo $SOURCE_IMAGE | sed -e 's/'$REGISTRY_URL'/'$TARGET_REPO'/');
    sudo docker tag $SOURCE_IMAGE $TARGET_IMAGE;
    echo "Pushing Image:" $TARGET_IMAGE;
    sudo docker push $TARGET_IMAGE
    sudo docker rmi $SOURCE_IMAGE;
    sudo docker rmi $TARGET_IMAGE;
done
```
